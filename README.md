 The pickle module reconstructs objects by executing the **reduce** method of serialized classes. Attackers can craft a payload to execute arbitrary code during deserialization.No validation of the input fileâ€™s integrity or source. Attacker-controlled file path or If the application fetches cookies from a network source without validation. First, create a Python file called calc, execute the code in the diagram to generate a malicious serialization file

 Create a python file named Exploit in the malicious serialization file directory and run it to trigger the deserialization execution calc
